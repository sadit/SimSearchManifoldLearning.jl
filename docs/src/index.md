# Using SimilaritySearch for ManifoldLearning

SimilaritySearch.jl is a library for nearest neighbor search. In particular, it contains the implementation for `SearchGraph`, a fast and flexible search index.

One of the main component of non-linear projection methods is the solution of large batches of `k` nearest neighbors queries. In this sense `SimilaritySearch` provides fast multithreaded algorithms using exact and approximated searching algorihtms.
